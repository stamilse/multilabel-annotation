The university need not give the kids enough to live on-they already have dorms, etc..  Further, the universities need not get ANY of the company to make it worth their effort-they could take 1% of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class, and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors, but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit.\r\n",

This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham's argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn't have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.\r\n",

So, while we may admire their achievements, it's often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a \"more mediocre\" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).\r\n",

This is supposed to be part of what college is for, but since the CS depts are dropping the ball, there is a niche open for a sort of DeVry-for-cool-languages-and-techniques, where you can prove competence in scheme, haskell, asm, etc., instead of with java.

      "That is commonly believed but not accurate.  C is a fairly bad assembler, as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to C.  It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible (at least, not portably).  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do (directly) in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.\r\n",

With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven't changed the behavior of your program.

      "I don't know what you mean by \"x,\" but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I'm told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn't (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it's important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).\n",
